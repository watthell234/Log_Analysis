Hello there!

This is Project 1 for Udacity's Nanodegree Program.

I was tasked to figure out how to create a Log Analysis report.

In order for you to obtain the proper reports you will need to:

1st have the newsdata.sql file.
2nd clone this repository.
3rd pip install psycopg2.
4th Make sure you have python3 install.
Lastly, run python repordb.py and Voila! you will have all 3 text files downloaded to your active directory.
